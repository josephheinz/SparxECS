# SparxEcs

A lightweight, generic Entity Component System (ECS) library for C# projects.

---

## Overview

SparxEcs is a simple and efficient ECS framework designed to help you manage entities and their components with minimal boilerplate and high performance. It supports:

- Dynamic entity creation and deletion
- Generic component registration and management
- Efficient querying for entities with single or multiple components
- Component cloning and entity duplication
- Internal reuse of entity IDs for memory efficiency

SparxEcs is suitable for games, simulations, or any application requiring flexible, data-driven architecture.

---

## Features

- Register and manage components of any type
- Add, set, get, and remove components per entity
- Query entities with one or more components with optional filtering
- Clone entities and copy components
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies (.NET Standard 2.1+ compatible)
- Easy integration into existing projects

---

## Installation

Install via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package SparxEcs
````

Or via the NuGet Package Manager:

```
Install-Package SparxEcs
```

---

## Usage Example

```csharp
using SparxEcs;

var ecs = new ECS();

// Register your components
ecs.RegisterComponent<Position>();
ecs.RegisterComponent<Velocity>();

// Create an entity
EntityID player = ecs.AddEntity();

// Add components
ecs.Add(player, new Position(10, 20));
ecs.Add(player, new Velocity(1, 0));

// Query entities with Position and Velocity components
foreach (var (pos, vel) in ecs.Query<Position, Velocity>())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Entity Position: {pos}, Velocity: {vel}");
}
```
